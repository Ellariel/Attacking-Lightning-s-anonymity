# Evaluation of Lightning's Anonymity
An attack that enables an intermediary to break the anonymity of the source and destination of a trannsaction in the Lightning network. 

This includes a simulator to simulate transactions using LND, c-Lightning and Eclair. We modify Eclair to use a generalized version of Dijkstra's algorithm instead of using Yen's algorithm.
